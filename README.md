>>OVER ALL
    I have 3 media state for the site, Phone, Tablet, PC





>>CSS

    >hamburgerBtn
    I have a hamburgerBtn in the Phone size of the site.
    It uses nth_child(odd) on the li of the ul to color the 1st and 3rd item in the menu.
    The button when pushed has javascript looking for a button press for the hamburgerBtn and when it sees the button pressed it will then call the javascript function (toggleMenu) to have it add a class of "Open" to the nav ul to open the menu.


    The phone and tablet share a state with the header.

    Nav changes states between all 3.

    Footer changes between phone to tablet and then it stays then same between tablet and desktop.
